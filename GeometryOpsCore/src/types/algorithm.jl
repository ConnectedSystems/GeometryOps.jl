# `Algorithm`s

An `Algorithm` is a type that describes the algorithm used to perform some [`Operation`](@ref).

An algorithm may be associated with one or many [`Manifold`](@ref)s.  It may either have the manifold as a field, or have it as a static parameter (e.g. `struct GEOS <: Manifold{Planar}`).


Algorithms are:
* Ways to perform an operation
* For example: LHuilier, Bessel, Ericsson for spherical area
* May be manifold agnostic (like simplification) or restrictive (like GEOS only works on planar, PROJ algorithm for arclength and area only works on geodesic)
* May or may not carry manifolds around, but manifold should always be accessible from manifold(alg) - it's not necessary that fixed manifold args can skip carrying the manifold around, eg in the case of Proj{Geodesic}.


## Single manifold vs manifold independent algorithms

Some algorithms only work on a single manifold (shoelace area only works on `Planar`)
and others work on any manifold (`simplify`, `segmentize`).  They are allowed to dispatch
on the manifold type but store that manifold as a field, and the fundamental algorithm is the 
same.  For example the segmentize algorithm is the same (distance along line) but the implementation
varies slightly depending on the manifold (planar, spherical, geodesic, etc).

Here's a simple example of two algorithms, one only on planar and one manifold independent:

```julia

struct MyExternalArbitraryPackageAlgorithm <: SingleManifoldAlgorithm{Planar}
    kw1::Int
    kw2::String
end # this already has the methods specified

struct MyIndependentAlgorithm{M <: Manifold} <: ManifoldIndependentAlgorithm{M}
    m::M
    kw1::Int
    kw2::String
end

MyIndependentAlgorithm(m::Manifold; kw1 = 1, kw2 = "hello") = MyIndependentAlgorithm(m, kw1, kw2)
```

end

NoAlgorithm() = NoAlgorithm(Planar()) # TODO: add a NoManifold or AutoManifold type?
# Maybe AutoManifold
# and then we have DD.format like materialization  

function (Alg::Type{<: SingleManifoldAlgorithm{M}})(m::M; kwargs...) where {M}
    # successful - the algorithm is designed for this manifold
    # in this case, just return `Alg(; kwargs...)`
    return Alg(; kwargs...)
end

function (Alg::Type{<: ManifoldIndependentAlgorithm{M}})(m::Manifold; kwargs...) where {M}
    # this catches the case where the algorithm doesn't match the manifold
    # throw a WrongManifoldException and be done with it
    throw(WrongManifoldException{typeof(m), M, Alg}())
end
