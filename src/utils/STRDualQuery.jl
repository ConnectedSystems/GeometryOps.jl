    maybe_overlapping_geoms_and_query_lists_in_order(tree_a::STRtree, tree_b::STRtree, edges_a::Vector{<: GI.Line}, edges_b::Vector{<: GI.Line})

Performs an efficient dual-tree traversal to find potentially overlapping geometry pairs.
Returns a vector of pairs, where each pair contains an index from tree_a and a sorted vector 
of indices from tree_b that might overlap.

The result looks like this:
```
[
    a1 => [b1, b2, b3],
    a2 => [b4, b5],
    a3 => [b6, b7, b8, b9],
    ...
]
```
in which the overlap map is sorted by the tree_a indices, and within each group, the tree_b indices are sorted.
