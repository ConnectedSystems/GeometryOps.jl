# # Polygonizing raster data
export polygonize
# The methods in this file are able to convert a raster image into a set of polygons,
# by contour detection using a clockwise Moore neighborhood method.

# The main entry point is the [`polygonize`](@ref) function.

# ```@doc
# polygonize
# ```

# ## Example

# Here's a basic implementation, using the `Makie.peaks()` function.  First, let's investigate the nature of the function:
# ```@example polygonize
# using Makie, GeometryOps
# n = 49
# xs, ys = LinRange(-3, 3, n), LinRange(-3, 3, n)
# zs = Makie.peaks(n)
# z_max_value = maximum(abs.(extrema(zs)))
# f, a, p = heatmap(
#     xs, ys, zs;
#     axis = (; aspect = DataAspect(), title = "Exact function")
# )
# cb = Colorbar(f[1, 2], p; label = "Z-value")
# f
# ```

# Now, we can use the `polygonize` function to convert the raster data into polygons.

# For this particular example, we chose a range of z-values between 0.8 and 3.2,
# which would provide two distinct polyogns with holes.

# ```@example polygonize
# polygons = polygonize(xs, ys, 0.8 .< zs .< 3.2)
# ```
# This returns a list of `GeometryBasics.Polygon`, which can be plotted immediately,
# or wrapped directly in a `GeometryBasics.MultiPolygon`.  Let's see how these look:

# ```@example polygonize
# f, a, p = poly(polygons; label = "Polygonized polygons", axis = (; aspect = DataAspect()))
# ```

# Finally, let's plot the Makie contour lines on top, to see how well the polygonization worked:
# ```@example polygonize
# contour!(a, zs; labels = true, levels = [0.8, 3.2], label = "Contour lines")
# f
# ```

# ## Implementation

# The implementation follows:

"""
    polygonize(A; minpoints=10)
    polygonize(xs, ys, A; minpoints=10)

Convert matrix `A` to polygons.

If `xs` and `ys` are passed in they are used as the pixel center points.

# Keywords
- `minpoints`: ignore polygons with less than `minpoints` points.
"""
