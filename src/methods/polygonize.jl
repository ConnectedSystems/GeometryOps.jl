# # Polygonizing raster data

export polygonize

# The methods in this file are able to convert a raster image into a set of polygons,
# by contour detection using a clockwise Moore neighborhood method.

## Example

#=
Here's a basic example, using the `Makie.peaks()` function.  First, let's investigate the nature of the function:

```@example polygonize
using Makie, GeometryOps
n = 49
xs, ys = LinRange(-3, 3, n), LinRange(-3, 3, n)
zs = Makie.peaks(n)
z_max_value = maximum(abs.(extrema(zs)))
f, a, p = heatmap(
    xs, ys, zs; 
    axis = (; aspect = DataAspect(), title = "Exact function")
)
cb = Colorbar(f[1, 2], p; label = "Z-value")
f 
```

Now, we can use the `polygonize` function to convert the raster data into polygons.

For this particular example, we chose a range of z-values between 0.8 and 3.2, 
which would provide two distinct polyogns with holes.

```@example polygonize
polygons = polygonize(xs, ys, 0.8 .< zs .< 3.2)
```
This returns a list of `GeometryBasics.Polygon`, which can be plotted immediately, 
or wrapped directly in a `GeometryBasics.MultiPolygon`.  Let's see how these look:

```@example polygonize
f, a, p = poly(polygons; label = "Polygonized polygons", axis = (; aspect = DataAspect()))
```

Finally, let's plot the Makie contour lines on top, to see how well the polygonization worked:
```@example polygonize
contour!(a, xs, ys, zs; labels = true, levels = [0.8, 3.2], label = "Contour lines")
f
```

## Implementation

The implementation follows:
=# 

"""
    polygonize(A::AbstractMatrix{Bool}; minpoints=10)
    polygonize(f, A::AbstractMatrix; minpoints=10)
    polygonize(xs, ys, A::AbstractMatrix{Bool}; minpoints=10)
    polygonize(f, xs, ys, A::AbstractMatrix; minpoints=10)

Polygonize an `AbstractMatrix` of values, currently to a single class of polygons.

For `Bool` eltype, a function is not needed. For other matrix eltypes, 
function `f` should return `true` or `false` based on the matrix values, 
translating to inside or outside the polygons.

If `xs` and `ys` are passed in they are used as the pixel center points.


# Keywords

- `minpoints`: ignore polygons with less than `minpoints` points.

# Example

```julia
using GeometryOps
multipolygon = polygonize(>(0.6), rand(100, 100), minpoints=3)
```
